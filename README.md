# Personality-Indicator

As part of my research, I worked on text data that contains posts of individuals collected from a community forum and their corresponding personality types given by MBTI. Following are my major contributions to the project:

 - Extracted descriptions from valid URLs using Beautiful Soup (a library in Python).
 - Handled misspelled and slang words in the text using SpaCy.
 - Determined the personality types of individuals with their given posts and checked for the validity of the original tool.
